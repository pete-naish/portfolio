                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="introductory">Our brief was to provide Birmingham Business School with a visual identity that reflected the personality traits and ambitions identified in the initial research and brand proposition phases of the project.</p>
                <p class="introductory">The challenge was to give the school a distinctive look, whilst still allying it closely with the university. It needed to be readily identifiable in a crowded, competitive marketplace. We also wanted to acknowledge the school's rich history and tradition but project a much more forward-looking, aspirational feel.</p>
                <p>The 'boilerplate' brand proposition sets the scene:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Our world-class research and teaching provides the insights, ambitions and skills to shape better, simpler and more sustainable business strategies. We put business in context and people at the heart of business.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Along with the baseline 'hygiene' factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>International &amp; diverse</li>
                    <li>Prestigious &amp; ambitious</li>
                    <li>Innovative &amp; enterprising</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are two key personality traits which we feel are vital to setting Birmingham Business School apart from its peer group:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Farsighted &amp; holistic</li>
                    <li>Empathetic &amp; committed</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We have used these to guide the design process.</p>

                <h2>The identity</h2>
                <h3>The relationship with the mother brand</h3>
                <p class="introductory">During the course of our research we quickly established that the school needed to maintain a close relationship with the university. There was never any question of the school becoming an autonomous organisation. There is a huge amount of brand equity in staying closely allied to the university: the challenge was to calibrate the weighting in that relationship.</p>
                <p class="introductory">The new identity is designed to reflect and endorse this close relationship when required, but is also flexible enough to let the school stand confidently on its own as and when necessary.</p>

        <div class="grid__row">
            <div class="grid--half">
                <h4>School name</h4>
                <p>The school name should be used on all communications, internal and external. To ensure consistent spacing the capital 'B' from Birmingham should be used as a measure. Three 'B' s give the right amount of padding.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid--half">
                <img src="assets/img/content/identity__school-name.png">

        <div class="grid__row">
            <div class="grid--half">
                <h4>How to use the name</h4>
                <p>When the school is leading the communication, it should be more prominent. The identity can be used to emphasise that this is a message from Birmingham Business School underpinned by the University of Birmingham.</p>
                <h4>Sizing relationship</h4>
                <p>As a guide for maintaining the correct relationship between the two components the full width of the 'Birmingham' in Birmingham Business School should be exactly equal to the 'Birmingham' in the University of Birmingham logo.</p>
                <h4>Position</h4>
                <p>With Birmingham Business School leading the communication, it should sit in the top left, with the University of Birmingham logo positioned bottom left. To keep the positioning consistent across all communications both Birmingham's should be left aligned.</p>
                <h4>The lock-up</h4>
                <p>In a situation where a communication piece requires co-branding, the two components appear as a lock-up. The University of Birmingham logo sits to the left of the school name at an equal height. The three 'B' spacing device should be used to ensure consistency.</p>

                <h4>Akzidenz Grotesk BQ</h4>
                <p>This typeface should be used on a smaller, more informative scale. Light, Regular and Medium are the preferred weights and can be used for body text.</p>
                <h4>New Baskerville ITC</h4>
                <p>This elegant typeface is used extensively across the university, usually in the regular weight and relatively small sizes. We would encourage the school to experiment using  New Baskerville ITC Bold in larger font sizes to give impact and character to the typography.</p>

                <h2>Imagery</h2>
                <h3>Photography</h3>
                <p class="introductory">Photography can help reinforce the core brand values and we suggest trying to utilize imagery with unusual angles to reference the 'seeing things from a different perspective' aspect of your personality. Including shots of groups of people interacting also references your empathetic/collaborative side.</p>

                <p>You are already employing strong graphical illustrations as part of the undergraduate programme and this artwork remains impactful. We would like to see this style retained for use alongside the new identity, although it might be worth reviewing the colourways to align them with the new primary colour palette.</p>

            <p class="introductory">The new colour palette for the school has been selected from the existing corporate brand palettes. We recommend assigning one of the four main colours to a particular audience group and then ensuring that that colour is used prominently in the communication.</p>
            <p>Please note that we have slightly adapted the dark red CMYK and Pantone references, this is so that the colour remains vibrant and accessible in the visual styling we have implemented.</p>

                <h3>How to use the facets</h3>
                <h4>Positioning</h4>
                <p>There is a good deal of flexibility in how the facets can be positioned and these guidelines illustrate many ways of using them. The only proviso is that the individual angles allocated to each colour must be maintained.</p>
                <h4>Sizing</h4>
                <p>Again, flexibility was our aim in creating these facets for the implementation team. The only 'rule' to observe is that the facets are always square and are always the same size in relation to each other.</p>

                <h4>Using the facets as individual components</h4>
                <p>Facets can be used as individual components if you need to address a specific audience. The system for this employs a horizon line from which the topmost point of the facet hangs. We don't want to be prescriptive about the exact height of this line, but if publications are being designed as a set, we would suggest that the same horizon line height is used for all of them.</p>

                <h3>Website</h3>
                <p>It was established at an early stage that the school would not have an independent website of its own. This means that the school has to work within the constraints of the existing main university website. The constraints being that the top header and left hand navigation on that site must be retained. Within the rectangle left encased by those two components there is a reasonable amount of flexibility.</p>
                <p>We have tried to indicate how the content could, and should, be edited back to concentrate on core information and messaging.</p>
                <p>The identity should be used boldly and there could be ways of employing the facets to act as functional components, signposting the way to specific content areas. The muted, neutral colours of the current website act as a foil to the boldness of the new identity colours.</p>

                <h2>Creating a tribe</h2>
                <p class="introductory">The research provided ample evidence that the school was suffering from a complete lack of identity. Although staff and students were well-disposed towards the school, they had nothing to hold on to and identify with. There was a clear hunger to feel a part of the school specifically rather than the overall university.</p>
                <p class="introductory">That is why the ideas in this section are so important. They range from the cheap and cheerful – cups, bags, brollies etc. – through to rather more ambitious projects such as facet transfers on the roof and custom signage. All are geared to giving the school a real sense of self. These are just the initial ideas we have had. The implementation team can use these as the basis for creating the flag for people to rally around.</p>

                <h2>Tone of voice</h2>
                <p class="introductory">Whenever we communicate on behalf of Birmingham Business School it should be in our tone of voice.

The following provides an outline as to the tone of voice to use in written communications.</p>

                <p>We believe in and value people. We believe business is about so much more than money, it’s about the people who work in businesses and organizations, their customers, suppliers and those in our society who rely on the wealth created by business.</p>
                <h4>We are 'world class' – excellent and sustainable</h4>
                <p>We are recognised through our triple accreditation with AACSB, AMBA and EQUIS as delivering sustainable world-class business and management education.
